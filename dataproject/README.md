# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **How do economic trends affect different levels of education in Denmark** and is mainly about how the unemployment was effected during the financial crisis and afterwards. This is examined for three levels of education; "Elementary school, "Vocational education" and "Master degrees". The development is then compared to the development of the GDP of Denmark from 2007 to 2018. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. AUL08.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanken.dk (Named AUL08 in the project)
1. NAN1.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanken.dk (Named BNP in the project)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
